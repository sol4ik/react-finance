## Dow Jones Industrial Average

**The Dow Jones Industrial Average** (ticket symbol **^DJIA**), Dow Jones, or simply the Dow, is a stock market index that measures the stock performance of **30 large companies** listed on stock exchanges in the United States.

Although it is one of the most commonly followed equity indices, many consider the Dow to be an inadequate representation of the overall U.S. stock market compared to broader market indices such as the S&P 500 Index or Russell 3000 because it only includes 30 large cap companies, is not weighted by market capitalization, and does not use a weighted arithmetic mean.
