# react-finance

Final project for Web delopment course (React development module).

## for development
In order to take part in development process you need to install the following packages besides **React**

* @material-ui/icons
* react-chartjs-2
* chart.js

You can do so by using **npm** as well as **yarn**.

I personally use **npm** so here's the example of installation

    npm i @material-ui/icons
    npm i react-chartjs-2
    npm i chart.js

## to do
Ideas for further development and better UX:
* **stats section**
    * bar chart on daily chages (colors to represent growth or withering)
    * table ob daily statistics values (previous close value, current open, current highest and so on)
* buttons bar for **navigation on time intervals**
    * choose start and end dates
    * choose step (daily, weekly, monthly)
