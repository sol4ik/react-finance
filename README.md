# react-finance

Final project for Web delopment course (React development module).

## packages used
In order to create beautiful (well.. more or less) UI I used the following packages besides **React**
* @material-ui/icons
* react-chartjs-2
* react-markdown
* react-text-collapse

## to do
Ideas for further development and better UX:
* **stats section**
    * bar chart on daily chages (colors to represent growth or withering)
    * table on daily statistics values (previous close value, current open, current highest and so on)
* buttons bar for **navigation on time intervals**
    * choose start and end dates
    * choose step (daily, weekly, monthly)
